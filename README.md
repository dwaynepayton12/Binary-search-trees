# Binary-search-trees

this is a project we did for the odin project to show our skills in creating Binary trees, and our skills preorder, post order and preorder depth traversal in a node tree


i would say this took me three days to write out the code for and write it out. and a day to debug as i made some mistakes with the typing of this algorithim as well.

but in overal difficulty was a 7 / 10 cause it was a lot to type and memorize i made some mistakes as well
